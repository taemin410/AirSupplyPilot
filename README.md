A pilot program for Air Supply program
The extent of this pilot program only consider areas near Queen Mary Hospital

For the users who want to place, process, or dispatch orders of medical supplies, the AS-P system is an internet-based application that will allow users to place orders, mark orders as being processed, and mark orders as being dispatched to a designated clinic through the web application. Clinics that will make use of this system, will not need to maintain their own supplies but can instead order the needed supplies through the AS-P system, so they can be delivered from the main hospitals to smaller clinics by drone. This will limit the wasting of supplies with limited shelf life and will save storage costs.

For the hospitals and health authorities, the AS-P will provide an efficient and precise system to manage and deliver medical supplies to clinics in need. With the use of drones, the warehouse and clinics would be able to transport supplies without delay.
